# DSA With Python

## Purpose of repo

I created this repository in order to hold solutions to Data Structure and Algorithim based problem sets using Python.
The problems and solutions are housed within folders and within the folders are .py files which hold the problems as comments and their
corresponding solution(s) in code. It is my hope that by practicing these kinds of problems I can strengthen my general problem solving and coding
skills.
